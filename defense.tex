            \item Combustion is predicted to remain the dominant energy conversion process for many years into the future
            \item The combustion of fossil fuels has been implicated in a number of harmful effects on human health, the environment, and the economy
            \item Two solutions have been proposed:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item<alert@4> Better engines
                    \item<alert@5> Better fuels

\begin{frame}{Methylcyclohexane is a major component in stepping-stone fuels}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Methylcyclohexane (MCH) is an important component of fuels
            produced from alternative petroleum sources, such as shale oil
        \item Models of real transportation fuels are difficult to
            construct and use due to the chemical complexity of the fuels
        \item Surrogate models use a limited number of components to
            represent the chemical and physical properties of the real fuel
        \item MCH is a component in many surrogate transportation fuel
            formulations
