    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combustion is predicted to remain the dominant energy conversion process for many years into the future
        \item The combustion of fossil fuels has been implicated in a number of harmful effects on human health, the environment, and the economy
        \item Two solutions have been proposed:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Better engines
                \item Better fuels
            \end{itemize}
